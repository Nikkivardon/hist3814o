# Week 3 fail log
This week I worked through module 1, excercises 1 through 3. I was able to use Markdown syntax quite well. I found the [Sarah Simpkin Tutorial](https://programminghistorian.org/en/lessons/getting-started-with-markdown) was really helpful in getting the basics down. I also learned how to use the Command Line feature on the Dh Box. I had a little trouble with setting up nano as I skipped over instruction 7. of excercise 2 whole trying to fix the error message. However, while I was able to mostly follow the instructions of the excercises, I struggled to understand the meaning of it all. I plan to do some research and reading so as to better understand it. I would have liked to attempt excercise four but time did not permit it as I underestimated the time required for this module. I will still try it on my own time. 

## First Annotation/Reading Question
My [first annotation](https://hyp.is/D3yFfnt4Eembzz8HO0FTqQ/www.trevorowens.org/2008/03/sunrise-on-methodology-and-radical-transparency-of-sources-in-historical-writing/) is from the Trevor Owens Reading in which he discusses how increasingly digital and open data and research may change how historians do their work. Navigating through the module this week, I realized how true this is. Research, projects,community engagement and knowledge exchange is drastically different in a digital world. While it is difficult or daunting at first, the capabilities are shocking. Hypothesis alone has been so beneficial to interact with other students and discuss the readings. Moreover, Markdown allows the "fluff" to be taken away from writing while also allowing it to be transfered to many platforms. 
### How are these scholars portraying themselves?
After going through the about me or portfolio sections of each author, a constant theme in each bio is presenting ones' scholarly achievements. This is not uncommon in biographies  or portfolios of this kind. Less dominant but still apparent was the authors efforts to make themselves reachable to readers, fellow scholars and students. [Caleb McDaniel](http://wcm1.web.rice.edu/index.html) and others feature their emails or social media accounts in this section. [Michelle Moravec](https://hyp.is/qIxyvnuNEem-G1fLvyaDpQ/michellemoravec.com/) discusses her use of an "open notebook" mentality as she posts drafts of her work. Moreover, her blog page has a well used comment section for communication with the community. 

## Second Annotation/Reading Question
My [second annotation](https://hyp.is/xLhoYnt5Eemlf4dcg1Ndlg/wcm1.web.rice.edu/open-notebook-history.html) is from the Caleb McDaniels reading. Mcdaniels highlights that at the root of "the business of writing" is sharing ones work. As a student I think that this is so important to foster learning. 
### How do they approach the idea of 'openness'?
While the authors make a convincing argument for increasing "openness", some of my fellow classmates have pointed out possible barriers to positive outcomes. The afforementioned annotation from the McDaniels' reading also raises the concern of copyright issues or validity issues when it comes to publishing. [Milligan](https://hyp.is/o6Zw6Ht9EemI7U8j9wFERg/ianmilligan.ca/2014/10/23/sshrcs-research-data-archiving-policy-and-historians/) sees no issue with this and argues that there is a sentiment in the community that s very protective of ones' work. I am not sure yet where I stand but I think that the authors of this weeks readings gloss over the possible issues with open notebooks. 

## Third Annotation/Reading Question
My [third annotation](https://hyp.is/o6Zw6Ht9EemI7U8j9wFERg/ianmilligan.ca/2014/10/23/sshrcs-research-data-archiving-policy-and-historians/) is from the Michelle Moravec reading. Though short, the Moravec reading articulates and important issue that the community has with "openness". The writing process is often difficult and long, I think that Moravec points out that "openess" can enrich this process and that the benefits far outweigh the negatives. 

## Comments/Concerns
This week was more successful than anticipated. I continue to enjoy the readings and the use of hypothesis. I feel that I am increasing my "tech" ability as well. I look forward to using the Dh Box more next week.
